Openmod took place on W13 2024, a very interesting workshop about open energy modelling and organized on this occasion by [CRESYM](https://cresym.eu/) and [G2Elab](https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/).

In this post, you will find the poster we presented about our project during the workshop. This poster serves as an introduction to our work and outlines the main goals of our research.
