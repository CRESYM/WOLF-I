**In a nutshell, WOLF-I aims at gaining a deeper understanding of the role of IBRs in the damping of inter-area oscillations and develop methods and tools to design POD controllers for new devices.**

It is a PhD work, with two main tasks:

- Conducting fundamental studies to assess the impact of IBRs on inter-area oscillation damping, by employing small-scale test cases.
- Designing POD controllers of devices such as FACTS and HVDC links, building reduced-order models based on large-scale models.

WOLF-I is a PhD work supervised by Comillas and sponsored by RTE.
