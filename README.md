# WOLF-I: Wide-area Oscillations of Low Frequency in Presence of IBRs

Welcome to the WOLF-I project repository. This project focuses on studying and analyzing the inter-area oscillations of low frequency that occur in the presence of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs). Our goal is to understand the dynamics of these oscillations and develop strategies to mitigate their impact on power systems.
